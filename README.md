# Owlcard-Example-Project
This project was designed, and implemented by my caapstone group of 4-5 peers. We collaborated with our client at Temple Universities OWLCARD Office over a period of two semesters to deliver this system. We designed user stories , test cases and Most viable product over the fisrt semester and implemented the system using ASP.NET, C#, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML5, SQL, with database running on temples server's to store all customers transactions. Our program digitized all forms in the office and made customer transactions more tim efficient and intuitive. 

How to use:

Download the ZIP file and run Owlcard.sln on visaul basic, then run the debugger. 

!!This program is not running correctly since there is no database being hosted on the backend, Localy run only for front end coding example and backend code example.
